Explanation



This example shows a simple calculator program in Java using if-else statements. It begins by taking user input for two numbers and an operator (+, -, , /). 

Then, it uses if-else statements to determine which operation to perform based on the operator entered. 

If the operator is '+', it performs addition; if '-', subtraction; if '', multiplication; and if '/', division. 

The Java code for calculator also checks for division by zero and handles invalid operators. 

Finally, it displays the result of the calculation.
